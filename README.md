# xarray-notebooks-climate

## Description


This repository contains several notebooks with examples of how to apply Pangeo tools (e.g. Xarray, Dask, cartopy.) to climate science problems. First, Let's start with computation of modes of climate variablity. More examples to be added.

## Software Packages

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Data structures and data analysis tools for tabular datasets
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) -  Numerical python computing tool for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/) -  For N-dimensional labelled arrays, NumPy-like multidimensional arrays.
- [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html) -  Python package designed for geospatial data processing and mapping
- [eofs](https://ajdawson.github.io/eofs/latest/index.html) - eofs is a Python package for EOF analysis of spatial-temporal data
- [xMCA](https://github.com/Yefee/xMCA) -  Inspired from eofs, is Maximum Covariance Analysis (sometimes also called SVD) in xarray.
